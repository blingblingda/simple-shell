NAME
	hsh - a simple Unix command interpreter

SYNOPSIS

	hsh

DESCRIPTION

	HSH is a custom shell implementation designed and developed as part of the curriculum at Holberton School and aims to demonstrate the knowledge of Unix system programming, specifically in writing a simple UNIX command interpreter. The Holberton School Simple Shell supports built-in commands, command execution with the $PATH environment variable, redirection, pipes, and basic error handling.

OPTIONS AND ARGUMENTS

	Options and arguments to the hsh command are not supported.

INVOCATION

	Upon launching the hsh, the interpreter initializes and enters an interactive mode, where it reads and processes user commands. When invoked, the shell sets up its environment, including the PATH variable, and automatically sources a configuration file, if present. The shell then displays a prompt and waits for user input. Users can enter commands, which are executed by the shell, and receive appropriate feedback. The shell continues to process commands in this manner until the user exits the shell using the 'exit' built-in command or by sending an interrupt signal (e.g., pressing Ctrl+C). The shell is designed to handle command execution, built-in commands, and basic error handling in a user-friendly manner, providing a seamless command-line experience.

PARAMETERS

	The hsh accepts and processes parameters for built-in and external commands. Parameters are passed to commands as arguments separated by spaces. For built-in commands, the shell interprets the parameters and performs the requested action accordingly. For external commands, the shell passes the parameters to the called program, which then processes them based on its implementation. Special characters are not handled.
